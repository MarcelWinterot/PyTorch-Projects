# Plans for improvements

## Dataset

### 1. Removing cities that only show up a few times throught the whole dataset

#### Don't know if it will work, but it's worth to give it a try

### 2. Extracting better features from the dataset

#### I belive the data we have currently are not the best, so I will have to play with the data in the near future

## Model

### 1. Experimenting with using different layers

#### Don't know if it will work, but experimenting with attention or convolutional layers is worth a shot

### 2. Creating a model that acts as a lookup table for cities to countries

#### Assuming current philosophy we create a model that predicts city and then a lookup table for city to country

#### We can either create it or create a model that acts as it
